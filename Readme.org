* Scheme in Rust

This is an experimental Scheme in Rust. It serves as an accompaniment to reading SICP, and has no purpose outside of that.

* Tasks
** TODO =EvaluationResult= needs spans
Error reporting could be improved by adding spans to =EvaluationResult=
** TODO Test for error messages reporting locations
Any error about evaluation or parsing should always carry positional information
** TODO Refactor
