* Scheme in Rust

This is an experimental Scheme in Rust. It serves as an accompaniment to reading SICP, and has no purpose outside of that.

* Tasks
** TODO =EvaluationResult= needs spans
Error reporting could be improved by adding spans to =EvaluationResult=
** TODO (+12) should not give invalid function head expression Int(12)
=+12= should be parsed as a symbol. It's also weird that =+12= doesn't just work now, because shouldn't it be a =Sym(+)= followed by =Int(12)=?
** TODO Test for error messages reporting locations
Any error about evaluation or parsing should always carry positional information. Refactor ReplError to carry a span and implement =fmt::Display=
** TODO Refactor
